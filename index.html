        <h1>
          Welcome to my website!
        </h1>
        <p>
          I'm Alex, and I am currently studying for a BEng in Electronic and Computer Engineering at the University of York.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in my free time I have taught myself to program, with my main interests being full-stack web development and game dev.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy making web apps in JavaScript, both frontend and backend with Node.js, and I have created a number of small applications to help family members organise and keep track of different things.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment, I am working on a game in C++ using the SDL graphics library, and I have also played around with the Unity game engine in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of my projects are on my GitHub account, and I can also be found on LinkedIn:<br><br>
